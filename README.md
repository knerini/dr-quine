# THE PROJECT : DR-QUINE
Subject version : 2.1
## Guidelines
This 42's School Project aims to start being familiar with quines programs. A quine takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
It's a "self-replicating program". The purpose of the project is to write 3 quines, each with its own rules :
- *Colleen* : a main function, another function called by the main function, a comment inside the main function and a comment outside the program.
- *Grace* : no main function declared, only 3 defines, one comment. The program has to write its source code in a file called `Grace_kid.<extension>`.
- *Sully* : an integer starting at 5. The program has to write its source code in a file called `Sully_X.<extension>` where X is the value of the integer of the source code, compile the file and execute it. The integer has to be decremented once at each program created while X is greater or equals to 0. 

Each program has to be wrote in 2 imposed languages : C and Assembly and 1 in a choosen language and not mandatory (bonus part), C++ is my choice. To validate the program, the `diff` command must show no difference between the source code and the output or the new file created, except for *Sully* where the only difference is the value of the integer.

## Make
Programs running under Linux.
- `make` : executes `make colleen`, `make grace` and `make sully`.
- `make colleen` : compiles and executes *Colleen* program and put the output in a tmp file.
- `diff_c` : executes the `diff` command between the source file and the tmp file.
- `make grace` : compiles and executes *Grace* program.
- `diff_g` : executes the `diff` command between the source file and the kid file.
- `make sully` : compiles and executes *Sully* program.
- `make diff_s1 X=<num>` : executes `diff` command between the source file and the Sully_X file designed by argument where num is a number in range 0 - 4.
- `make diff_s2 X1=<num> X2=<num>` : executes `diff` command between one Sully_x file and another Sully_x file designed by arguments where num is a number in range 0 - 4.
- `make help` : explains each rule.

# QUINES
## Language : C
### Colleen
Usage of `printf` specifying the argument number with `$` to reuse the same argument many times, making the code shorter and the `printf` function lighter.
### Grace
Usage of `dprintf` same way as `printf` for *Colleen* but to write in a specified `fd`.
### Sully
Usage of `dprintf` as *Grace* and `sprintf` to write in a specified `char *`, same way as `printf` for *Colleen*. Usage of `system` to execute commands to compile and execute another file inside the code. Easier than using `execve` avoiding the need to use `fork` and the need to handle environment or absolute path, making the code shorter and lighter for a quine.
## Language : Assembly
### Colleen
To not do a call to the extern C function `printf`, that make the challenge too easy and not fully Assembly, I've chose to create my own parsing to handle escaping characters. The data string `s` is written with special characters that will be replaced by the escaped character when printed. The string is made as follows :
- `*` for `/n`.
- `#` for `"`.
- `^` for the string itself.
### Grace
The data string is handled the same way as *Colleen*. The real challeng is the no declared main that cause trouble at compilation. To compile and execute a program without a declared main, the compilation rule in the Makefile is different : usage of the flags `-nostartfiles` and `-e start`.
- `-nostartfiles` : tells the compiler/linker not to include the standard startup files (`crt0.o` or `crt1.o`) in the final executable. These files initialize the runtime environment and call the main function. Omitting these startup files prevents unnecessary overhead and avoids requiring a main function.
- `-e start`: specifies the entry point of the programâ€”the address where execution begins when the program is loaded. In my program I've called it `start`.
### Sully
The data string is handled the same way as *Colleen* but there is more characters to escape with :
- `&`for `'`.
- `@` for the number to decrement and to write in the new file.

The commands are executed using syscall to `fork`, `execve` and `waitid`.
## Language : C++
### Colleen
Usage of raw string litteral `R` to print a string without the need to handle escaped charaters. A placeholder `{}` is used too to only handle parenthesis and put the data string.
### Grace
Usage of raw string litteral `R` like *Colleen* and the filestream functionality of the language.
### Sully
Same behavior as *Grace* to handle string and filestream. Call of the `system` function to handle the commands. It's important to replace the placeholder of the string before the placeholder of the integer.
