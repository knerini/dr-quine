# THE PROJECT : DR-QUINE
Subject version : 2.1
## Guidelines
This 42's School Project aims to start being familiar with quines programs. A quine takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
It's a "self-replicating program". The purpose of the project is to write 3 quines, each with its own rules :
- Colleen :
- Grace :
- Sully :

Each program has to be wrote in 2 imposed languages : C and Assembly and 1 in a choosen language and not mandatory (bonus part), C++ for me.
